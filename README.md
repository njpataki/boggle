# boggle

This program runs a game of boggle where human and computer meet head-to-head! It is a Stanford CS106B classic. 
The main focus of the programming is on designing and implementing recursive algorithms. At the heart of the program 
are two recursive functions that find words on the board, one for the human player and another for the computer.
